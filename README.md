# FACTOID QUESTION ANSWERING CHATBOT


Factoid Question Answering Chatbot is a simpler version of question answering system. It answers to the question asked by user in near real time using information retrieval and natural language processing technique. Chatbot is able to answer Factoid and Summarization based question from article of various domains with an accuracy of 70.16% (measured on SQuAD dataset of stanford).

## SYNOPSIS

To run bot:
```sh
	$ python3 P2.py <path_to_article>
```

For example:
```sh
	$ python3 P2.py dataset/Marvel_Comics.txt
```

Once bot is up and start running, it will ask you to enter your question. And respond with answer.

## METHODOLOGY

Architecture of this bot closely follow the architecture described in the book. Main modules of the QA System are:

> **Question Processing** : In this step, bot identifies type of question and
	type of answer it expects

> **Passage Retrieval** : It generates question vector and vectors of passage
	using TF-IDF as feature, it computes cosine similarity between question 
	vector and passage vector returning top 3 closely resembling passage. Furthur
	improvement to this step has been done by removing Stop Words and using 
	Porter Stemmer

> **Sentence Retrieval** : After retrieving passage, it tokenize sentences and
	computes ngram similarity between question and sentence. Thus identifying 
	most relevant sentences. 

> **Answer Processing** : Based on the expected answer type, then it process
	the answer sentence to identify particular entity using name-entity
	recognization technique and part of speech tagging technique

> **Text summarization** : If type of question is definition or bot is unable
	to identify named-entity from question, it summarize the text using ngram
	tilting technique

## RUNNING THE TEST

Test script is included in this repository. Test script uses **Stanford Question Answer Dataset (SQuAD)** to ask question and match bot's answer with human tagged answer.

```sh
$ python3 testQA.py
```

Test script outputs the no of question and correct retrieval of the answer. And match this answer with what was tagged by human. It computes the accuracy of the QA answer prediction and stores final result in "accuracy.csv" 

Accuracy of prediction is defined by:

```python
		accuracy = No. of correct prediction/No. of Total Prediction
```

## RESULT

### Result of Passage Retrieval
Accuracy of passage retrieval using TF-IDF was **69.69%** when tested over 422 articles of SQuAD dataset and approx 87599 questions cross domain.

After removing stopwords and using Porter Stemmer, this accuracy parameter improved to **77.49%**.

On Further analysis, **94.23%** of passage retrieval contains the equivalant  paragraph in top 3 returned paragraph.

## Result of Question Answer System

Overall Average over entire dataset was **64% correct answer prediction**. Dataset included in this repository has following accuracy:
